      <h2 class="hightlight">About Pat's Salmon Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Your friend Pat has come up with a business idea by combining two signature Seattle icons: Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies.  They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever. Tourists will go gaga for them, locals will begrudgingly fall in love with them, and all will be right with the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission here at Pat's Salmon Cookies is to ...The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. And save the world from the evils of big business.
